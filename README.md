# Emirates Skywards Improvement

## Inspiration

We have decided to tackle Emirates' challenge 2 - to improve the personalised customer experience in the airport by enabling "roving agents" to serve customers not only in the lounge, but "where and when" customers wish to be served.

Some of us have done projects related to Internet of Things (IOT) in the past, so this problem actually struck a chord with us, being somewhat familiar with IOT.

## What it does

In our system design, we chose to use Emirates' existing beacons in the Dubai international airport and triangulation algorithms in order to determine the location of customers, in order for roving agents to serve them where and when they want it.

Using this personalised location service, customers can actually make various service requests to the roving agents, and know how long the agents will take to service them. 

## How we built it

We built the admin dashboard using the Vue.js framework and the user application with Flutter.

## Where do you see Emirates Skywards in a few months?

In the long term, we believe that the data collected through the application can be stored and analyzed in order to uncover hidden patterns in the data - better enabling Emirates to optimize the allocation of resources

Also, another plausible method of scaling would be to implement similar systems in other airports, not just the Dubai international airports, so that Emirates customers worldwide are able to enjoy similar privileges and experiences
